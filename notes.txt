usersâ€™ onchain behavior and in particular, loyalty patterns. Use publicly available data, like Dune or other datasets, to answer the following key questions. 
For the sake of simplicity, assume the following:
The relevant data period is the 6 months

SEGMENTATION: 

How would you segment our user base? Define 3-4 meaningful user personas based on transaction patterns, volumes, and frequency.

-> New to Relay (First 5 times using Relay) 
-> Beginner Explorer (only active on 1 or 2 of EVM + tied SVM if applicable)
-> Advanced Programmatic (Extremely high NONCE >10,000)
-> Token-Consistent / Strategy Consistent (low variance in day of the week, # of unique tokens, # of source-destination pairs, # total chains touched)

Are there meaningful patterns associated with Users FIRST Relay? 
For example, to users typically find us by first using a long tail chain (hm, long-tail? need to look at the attached data)
-> Most common token (probably gas token of chain. if stablecoin probably USDC lol. Do they do cross gas swaps?)

LOYALTY: 
What is bridge loyalty? Exclusive vs non-exclusive. rate-shopping vs convenience (token overlaps? time of day overlaps? is it churn or opportunity?)
Segmentation of loyal vs non-loyal. What does clustering show?

# Data Exploration Notes
Scanned first 5 rows of each file, schemas all match.
Exploring- tx hash 0xd2804723cf789b4a5cc19a8a66bf5fab481a705b4a17ef2d36f2d999f4659c1f
is in the relay april data as crosschain swap base -> bsc 19.825 usdc -> 19.48 usdt; 
but base scan labels it a Metamask Bridge (LiFi adapter). Looks like user sends 20 USDC; 
but then Metamask takes their 0.175 (0.875%) cut; and then LiFi forwards the 19.825. 
(1.7% is higher than expected relay cut 19.825 -> 19.48)

Relay Solver address is the final recipient on Base (from LiFi)

Interesting, looks like the Solver is an EOA (originates the bsc tx). $11M held hot across major EVMs. Not sure I'd recommend this architecture choice.
Hm, what is this address? 0xeeeeee9eC4769A09a76A83C7bC42b185872860eE multicall permit? is this a relay specific contract?   
Not in any of the relay docs. But the solidity mentions permit-relay.

------------------------

IS_CALL = TRUE (is this just a forwardWithData binary?)
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd060da87999daee8b64b2f432e3cbe5013ad790fee9a0365b781da91797e12b9
Oh? IS_CALL might be a function call on other side (here, OP buys an NFT SeaDropMint) 
https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x511401481a873e8fe7fb6e302a16b50fdd900437a3a4f11e236f4e02f07e46c9#eventlog


IS_CALL = FALSE (no, this simple bridge from ETH is also forwardWithData but IS_CALL is false)
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1ebdacd85df61a792439f214eaf08267ee8abbf458e97df0d00d17bc429ca3b4
(weird, ETH on ETH->ARB took only 0.002% essentially free EVM->L2 raw transfers?? - will check this)

-------------------------
Considering some clusters like 
-> complex tx (IS_CALL = TRUE)
-> Niche Chain User (ink, unichain, abstract zksync. Some chains are dying check those usages later)
-> straight-to-business (looking for absolute cheapest EVM<->EVM raw ETH moves if it really is 0.002% fee lol)
-> cross-chain cross-gas (big niche for explorers) 

--------------------------------

Top 10 wallet review: 
This address is an outlier, seems to be the LiFi Diamond Contract, routes to 
Relay 1.9M times. Let's separate that from analysis.
