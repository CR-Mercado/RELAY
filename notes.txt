usersâ€™ onchain behavior and in particular, loyalty patterns. Use publicly available data, like Dune or other datasets, to answer the following key questions. 
For the sake of simplicity, assume the following:
The relevant data period is the 6 months
The relevant networks are Ethereum, Base, Optimism, BSC, Arbitrum, Solana
Our relevant Competitors are Gas.Zip, Across, and Debridge

SEGMENTATION: 

How would you segment our user base? Define 3-4 meaningful user personas based on transaction patterns, volumes, and frequency.

-> New to Relay (First 5 times using Relay) 
-> Beginner Explorer (only active on 1 or 2 of EVM + tied SVM if applicable)
-> Advanced Programmatic (Extremely high NONCE >10,000)
-> Token-Consistent / Strategy Consistent (low variance in day of the week, # of unique tokens, # of source-destination pairs, # total chains touched)

Are there meaningful patterns associated with Users FIRST Relay? 
For example, to users typically find us by first using a long tail chain (hm, long-tail? need to look at the attached data)
-> Most common token (probably gas token of chain. if stablecoin probably USDC lol. Do they do cross gas swaps?)

LOYALTY: 
What is bridge loyalty? Exclusive vs non-exclusive. rate-shopping vs convenience (token overlaps? time of day overlaps? is it churn or opportunity?)
Segmentation of loyal vs non-loyal. What does clustering show?
